# pyTube-bot

Bot for downloading YouTube videos.

The bot allows you to download videos from YouTube using a url link. The principle of operation is as follows: first, frames are loaded separately in the selected (in this case, the highest) resolution, after which the audio track is loaded. After the successful completion of both processes, audio and video frames will be combined into one. The resulting material is installed in the folder selected on the device.
